## Course Summary

This course is a graduate-level seminar course on physics-based animation. It will involve reading state-of-the-art papers in the field and implementing algorithms from those papers. The course will feature a final project based on the topic. The course will be delivered in an online synchronous fashion. 
  
Students are expected to read background material as necessary and should be comfortable with elementary linear algebra, geometry,
and vector calculus. 

## Course Structure
This 12 week course is split into two 6 week parts. The first part is a graduate *seminar* course on physics-based animation which will involve reading, analyzing and commenting on both seminal and cutting-edge works in the field. The second part of the course is *project* focused, in which students will work in groups on "grand challenges" in physics-based animation. During this time, only one paper will be discussed per lecture.

### Seminar Sessions
Each week, **two (2)** papers will be assigned for discussion and to structure the discussion, students will be assigned roles. Roles will change each week and they are:

| Role | Number | Description |
| ---- | :------------ |:------------|
| Authour | 1| Congratulations, "your" paper has been accepted to an important conference! Prepare a 15-20 minute presentation about "your" work. Because there's a pandemic on, you can either deliver the presentation live on Zoom or submit a prerecorded video. 
| Implementer|1| You've stumbled across a fascinating paper in the depths of the internet that you'd love to use in your research. Bad news! There's no code available! Implement as much of the algorithm as you can from the information given in the paper. Prepare to discuss what the paper explains well, and what it explains poorly, with regard to implementation.|
| Reviewers |~~3~~ 2| You've made it to the big time, and the fate of computer graphics rests in your hands. Fill out the SIGGRAPH review form for this paper, decide whether the paper should be accepted or rejected and prepare to make the final decision, with your fellow reviewers, in class. |

### Project Sessions 
Project sessions will involve discussing project progress, current problems and potential solutions. Each week, all project groups will present a 5 minute summary of their project which will reiterate the **project goal**, discuss **current progress**, outline **next steps** and highlight  **technical problems** and **solutions**. 

## Project Details
Projects will be done in groups and must fit into one of the "grand challenges" below. Week 7 will be the *pitch day* for projects. Each student will be allowed to pitch a project idea. All students will submit a ranked list of projects they would like to work on, and from this list, I will create a number of 3-5 person groups for the most popular projects. 

**Deliverable:**  a micro-SIGGRAPH submission comprised of a **two (2) page** extended abstract and **five (5) minute** submission style video.

**Due Date:** December 18th, 11:59pm

### Grand Challenges (more details and examples coming soon)
All projects must fall into one of the grand challenge categories below:
1. Differentiable Physics Simulation
2. Direct Simulation from Computer-Aided-Design Tools
3. Biomechanical Simulation for Digital Humans
4. Machine Learning for Material Behaviour

### Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is a very serious matter and can result in very serious
consequences. Note that academic offences may be discovered and handled
retroactively, even after the semester in which the course was taken for credit.
This is a challenging class aimed at teaching you the fundamentals of computer
graphics. You wont learn much if you cheat but you might get a good grade if you
get away with it. If all you want is a good grade take an easier class where you
wont have to cheat!

For purposes of this class, academic dishonesty is defined as:

- Any attempt to pass off work on a test that didn't come straight out of your
  own head.
- Any collaboration on written or programming assignments (its ok to share ideas
  on programming assignments but the code MUST be your own) in which the
  collaborating parties don't clearly and prominently explain exactly who did
  what, at turn-in time.
- Any activity that has the effect of significantly impairing the ability of
  another student to learn. Examples here might include destroying the work of
  others, interfering with their access to resources (e.g., digital cameras), or
  deliberately providing them with misleading information.

### Email & GitHub Issues

- The GitHub issues are for answering questions about class or about the assignments. The TAs will be monitoring the posted issues.
- Appropriate use of the issues: clarifications on assignment, on lecture
  material, general concerns about the course, or other remarks that are
  appropriate for all students to see/participate in.
- Do NOT broadcast pieces of your code or answers to written assignments to the issues page. Specific or general implementation questions whose answer
  would benefit all students in the class are appropriate. However: the bulletin
  board is NO replacement for the tutorial hour. That should be the main forum
  for asking/answering questions of this sort.
- Questions of the form "I cannot find the problem with my code; here it is, can
  you help me" are unlikely to be replied, so don't count on it. If you have a
  question with code, take it to the TA office hours or to the tutorials.
